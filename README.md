# HeavyVectorTriplet

In this repository we store the theory inputs (cross section and branching ratios) for HVT interpretations of the searches for W' and Z' decaying in dibosons

- HVT model B, in `HVTB_XS.csv`
- HVT model C with cH = 1 and cH = 3, in `HVTC_XS.csv`

The script on `13TeV/format_inputs/format_in_csv.py`, merelly formats the inputs taken from the several analyses codes to a common format. We keep commited for reference.
